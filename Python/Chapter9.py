#!Data structures are harder, so this chapter will have its on file
#Chapter 9.1 exercises:
    #cardinal_numbers = "first","second","third"; #creates a tuple packed with 3 values
    #position1,position2,position3 = cardinal_numbers; #create variables that hold the values packed in the tuple
    #print(position1,position2,position3); #*demonstration of packing and unpacking of variables
    #name = tuple("lucas"); 
    #print("x" in name);
