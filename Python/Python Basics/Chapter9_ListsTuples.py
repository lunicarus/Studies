# ?Chapter 9.1 Turples exercises:
# cardinal_numbers = "first","second","third"; #creates a tuple packed with 3 values
# position1,position2,position3 = cardinal_numbers; #create variables that hold the values packed in the tuple
# print(position1,position2,position3); #*demonstration of packing and unpacking of variables
#name = tuple("lucas");
#print("x" in name);

# ? Create a tuple called my_name that contains the letters of your name
# ? by using tuple() and a string literal.

# myname = tuple("lucas");
# firstletter = myname[0:1];
# print(f"\n{firstletter} is the first letter of my name and {myname} is my name\n")

# ?Chapter 9.2 Lists Exercises:
# food = ["rice", "beans"];
# food.extend(["bread", "pizza"]);
# print(f"{food[0:2] }");
# breakfeast = "eggs, milk, bread, apple"
# breakfeast = breakfeast.split(", ");
# lengths = [ len(food) for value in breakfeast];
# print(lengths);
# numbers = [0,1,10,9,8,20,6,2,99];
# numbers.sort(reverse=True);
# print(numbers);

# ? Exercise number 1 and 2, pag 260.
# data = ((1,2),(3,4));
# for element in data:
#     print(sum(element)); #todo "bruh I did this first try what? damn" 2022-02-26"
