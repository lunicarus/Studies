I want to create a Python programm that analyzes payment data from an Excel/Doc File, Extract it and organize it in accordance to a defined parameter.
It will organize the data and create a new file with the new data, as it would be easier to compare both files to see if the programm worked properly.

functions of the programm 

1.Organize Payment by date 
the programm will take the data from the file, organize it from the earliest to the latest paymant date.

2.Organize Payment by store
The program will divide the payments that need to be done by store, and possibly by earliest to latest paymant date.

3.Organize Payment by name
Same process, but by the alphabetic order of the client/worker that is being paid.

4.Organize Payment by value
same process, but from lowest to highest value.
..........................................................
depending on what is easier, i will built the functions in the programm piece by piece until it has all for, and continue upgrating it further with new functionalities

-further down the road, implement front-end in the programm to make it more easier to use and more 

considerations:
- from research, it is possible to extract data from a Excel file using python.
- is it possible to do the same with a Doc file, as long as it is properly organized?
- Would SQL make it easier? how?
