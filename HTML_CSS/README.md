# Unfinished Project(for now)

Here is a unfinished project for a website I tried to do in a week for a job

I ultimately failed, and had no desire to continue with it. But I hope to one day return and finish it after I learn enough.

It's also a good reminder of how I used to Code in WebDesign and I like to keep it as memento, a way for me to see how much I progressed over time.
